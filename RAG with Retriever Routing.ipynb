However, this feeling was possibly due to fear of erection happening. Also, I had a feeling in my heart when she touched me. However, as it was straight from waking up, I couldnt think properly and my mind just let it be. In the end, there was no obvious erection that occurred. Does this constitute hurmat musahara. Also, what is the meaning of shahwat for this masala. I have read on two respected websites different definitions. One says the occurrence of an erection, whilst the other says an arousing feeling in the private part. Please help me, as this is distressing me a lot, along with the possible implications.'}"

      "Ahadith: {'query': 'Q: Please help. Me and my wife had an argument and I have said to her here is your car keys and your house keys bye bye meaning I left you. I think I was just angry and wanted to punish her or make her worried and I dont really know what my intention was when I said these words. I left the house but came back after 20 minutes when my anger was gone and we said sorry to each other and continued normal, and we never had anything like that again. I dont think I was ready to divorce her but I was angry with her and I am having doubts of my intentions when I said these words. Am I just confused? This happened 8 months ago and now she is pregnant. Please help having known these words could be considered divorce I am 100% sure I wouldnt have said it. I love my wife and I think the reason why I said these words is because I wanted her to stop this arguments I think, but I wasnt sure if I wanted to divorce her maybe I was treating her or something, I really cant remember what was going through my head but I wouldnt give her talaq maybe I was just angry and wanted to make her afraid. But I didnt think I wanted to leave her for good thats one thing I am sure of. What is my situation brother? Is she still my wife? I wrote to Islamic Sharia council uk and this is what they said (These words without clear and firm intention of divorce, will not constitute an Islamic Divorce.) Is this correct because if this is correct my intention was not firm for divorce. Brother when I said these words to her if she would have said to me at that time give me a talaq I would have said to her NO, so brother do you think I was treating her but didnt want to divorce her judging by my first sentence? --T--'}"
