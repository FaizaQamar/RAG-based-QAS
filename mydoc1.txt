INCORRECT BELIEFS AND ACTIONS
After this, it seems appropriate to mention a few incorrect beliefs, evil customs, and major sins which
are committed quite often and which cause a shortcoming in one's Imaan. In mentioning these things,
it is hoped that people will guard themselves from them. Some of these are absolute kufr and shirk,
some are very close to kufr and shirk, others are innovations and delusions, while others are sins. It is
therefore necessary to safeguard one's self from all of them. After mentioning these things, a few
worldly harms of sinning and worldly benefits of good deeds will be mentioned. Since people tend to
give more attention to worldly gains and losses, it is hoped that in this way there will be the desire to
do good and abstain from evil.
Kufr and Shirk
This chapter deals with those aspects that have a special connection with kufr and shirk either because
these aspects necessitate kufr and shirk, or because they are customs and habits of the kuffar and
mushrikeen, or they have traces of shirk, or because they lead to kufr and shirk.
The following are forbidden in the Shariah:
1. To like kufr, to appreciate the things of kufr, and to make someone else commit an act of kufr.
2. To express regret or remorse at one's own Imaan due to some reason or other, e.g. by thinking
that if he were not a Muslim, he could have attained such and such a thing.
3. To say the following things out of grief on the death of one's children or close ones: "Allâh
wanted to kill him only", "he was the only person left in the world for Allâh to kill", "Allâh
should not have done this", "No one perpetrates such brutality as You have done."
